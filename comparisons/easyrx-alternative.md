# EasyRx Alternative: Modernizing Prescription Management

If you are looking for an **EasyRx alternative**, you are likely looking for a smoother, more cost-effective way to handle digital prescriptions and universal lab tracking.

## Why Technical Teams are Switching

While EasyRx is a powerful platform, many labs switch to **SimpleLabOS** for three main reasons:

### 1. The "Hidden" Complexity
**EasyRx** can be complex to configure for small teams. **SimpleLabOS** uses a "Zero Configuration" philosophy — you sign up and scan your first QR code within 5 minutes.

### 2. Universal Order Entry
SimpleLabOS doesn't just handle prescriptions; it manages the entire lab lifecycle:
- **Intake**: Auto-import from Medit/3Shape.
- **Production**: Visual Kanban boards for technicians.
- **Shipping**: Integrated label printing.
- **Invoicing**: Automated billing with QuickBooks sync.

### 3. Pricing for Production Labs
We don't "nickel and dime" on features. Our pricing is transparent and built for labs that prioritize production speed.
