# Best Free LIMS for Small Labs (2026 Review)

Searching for a **Free LIMS** (Laboratory Information Management System)? 

### 🛑 The Reality of "Free"
Most "Free" LIMS software on the market falls into two categories:
1.  **Open Source (Self-Hosted)**: Free to download, but you'll pay $200+/mo in server costs and DevOps time to keep it secure and HIPAA compliant.
2.  **Freemium**: Limited to 2-3 users or 10 cases/month — essentially a demo.

## The SimpleLabOS Approach
We believe the "Setup Fee" is the biggest barrier for small labs. That's why we offer:
- **$0 Setup Fee**.
- **14-Day Full Access Trial** (No credit card).
- **Free Basic Tier** for micro-labs (1-2 people).

## Top Free Alternatives & Comparisons

| Name | Best For | The Catch |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **OpenLIMS** | Academic Labs | Requires deep Linux knowledge to host securely. |
| **Generic Table (Excel)** | Hobbyists | Zero HIPAA compliance, zero automation. |
| **SimpleLabOS** | **Production Labs** | Minimal monthly fee for maximum automation. |

### 🚀 Getting Started Without the "Enterprise" Price Tag
If you are currently using Excel to track cases, you are losing money on data entry mistakes.
