# Why Excel is (Quietly) Killing Your Lab's Growth

Most lab owners started with a spreadsheet. It's free, it's flexible, and everyone knows how to use it. But as you scale past 2 technicians, Excel becomes a liability.

## 📉 The Hidden "Excel Tax"

### 1. The "Where is Case #1024?" Phone Call
When a doctor calls, you have to find the spreadsheet, search for the row, and hope the technician updated it. This 5-minute distraction happens 10 times a day. **That's 50 minutes of lost production.**

### 2. Manual Data Redundancy
Entering the same patient name in Excel, then in your billing software, then on a shipping label.
**SimpleLabOS allows you to enter once, scan many.**

### 3. Zero HIPAA / Audit Trail
Spreadsheets have no version control or secure access logs. If a row gets accidentally deleted, the case is lost.

## ⚡️ The 5-Minute Upgrade
Switching to a "Modern OS" for your lab doesn't mean a month of training.
